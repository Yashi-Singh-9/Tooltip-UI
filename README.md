# Tooltip UI - Navigation Tooltip Project

## Description

The **Tooltip UI** project focuses on creating interactive tooltips for navigation links using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript. This project aims to help developers understand key CSS concepts like positioning, hover effects, and transitions. When a user hovers over a navigation item, a tooltip appears to provide additional context for the item.

This project is part of the [Roadmap.sh Tooltip UI Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/tooltip-ui) and serves as an excellent opportunity to master dynamic UI effects with CSS.

### Features

- **Tooltips on Hover**: Displays additional information about a navigation item when hovered.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Provides a sleek user experience with CSS-based animations.
- **CSS-Only Implementation**: No JavaScript required.
- **Easy to Customize**: Simple HTML attributes and CSS allow for easy modifications to tooltips.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Works on most modern browsers.
  
### Alternatives

While many tooltip implementations use JavaScript for added interactivity, this project offers a lightweight, CSS-only approach that prioritizes performance and simplicity.
